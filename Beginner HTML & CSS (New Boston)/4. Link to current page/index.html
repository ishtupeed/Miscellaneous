<h2><a name="wrong"></a>Posting in the wrong place</h2>
<p>You are not to post the same thread twice, be it in the same
section or in two separate sections. Of course we understand that
you can accidentally hit the submit button twice, but posting a
topic a second time just to give it more attention will result in
one of the topics being deleted or locked dependent on the
situation. If one of the topics has already received helpful 
replies, the other topic will be locked, linking to the topic
that will remain open. Accidental double posts will be deleted 
without any further consequences for the user.</p>

<p>This also goes for posting posts in the wrong topics. Post 
topics and posts in the correct place. This means uestions about 
PHP go in the PHP forum, and not the PHP Tutorials section or Web
Development seciton, for example.</p>

<h2><a name="farm"></a>Post count farming</h2>
<p>Sometimes people try to boost their post count artificially by 
posting short and/or useless messages. This is not to be done, 
and we therefore don't allow people to post in forum games very 
quickly after eachother. If you posted in one, don't respond to
it again for a certain amount of time.</p>

<p>Bumping topics falls under this category as well. Bumping a 
topic means posting a message in it just to bring it up to the
top of the tpoic list again. Especially in the sections where we 
try to help people with their programming problems, this is quite 
annoying. Don't do it. Your topic will get attention, just be
patient.</p>

<h2><a name="caps"></a>CAPS etc.</h2>
<p>We're a community, therefore we should be able to communicate 
properly. So don't write posts with only caps, and try not to use
shorthand words (so how r u today?) and things in similar vein.</p>

<h2><a name="ads"></a>Advertising</h2>
<p>Advertising web sites or products that you are in some way
affiliated with is not allowed. This goes for any and all
advertisements. Advertisements will be removed instantly, no
exceptions.</p>

<p>You are, however, allowed to advertise one thing in your 
signature. No more.</p>

<h2><a name="copyright"></a>Copyright</h2>
<p>You are not allowed to post anything that you didn't make if 
you do not have the permission to do so. For example, if there's
a news item you want to discuss, don't copy/paste the entire
article, but link to it, and then quite small portions of the 
article that you want to discuss specifically. This is because
those articles are protected by copyright. Copyright infringments
are the worst kind of violations, as they may have an effect on 
the entire site, in the sense that it can be taken down! So you
should take this very seriously. In similar vein, we will act 
on copyright infringments very seriously and severely.</p>

<p>Of course this isn't limited to just written works. Visual
works, software, code and other creations are often also 
protected.</p>
